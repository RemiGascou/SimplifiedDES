A simplified version of Data Encryption Standard

## What is Data Encryption Standard (DES) ?

The Data Encryption Standard (DES) is a cryptosystem based on asymetric cryptography.
It was published by Diffie and Hellman in a paper entitled "New directions in Cryptography" in 1976.

The DES was considered secure until 2002, when it has been replaced by the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), much more secure.

## Relationship Data Encryption Standard (DES) and SimplifiedDES

SimplifiedDES is a project used to get a deeper understanding of the DES.
